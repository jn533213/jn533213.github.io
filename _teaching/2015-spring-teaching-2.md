The Canadian Atlantic Bottom Observations Temperature-Salinity (CABOTS) data product is a gridded sea floor temperature and salinity data product, containing measurements in Atlantic Canada and Eastern Arctic since 1980. CABOTS consists of yearly seasonal maps (spring, summer, fall) on a 0.125 longitude by 0.125 latitude grid. Values were restricted between 39-80 degrees North and 70-42 degrees West. Sea floor temperature and salinity were determined using a novel interpolation methodology which acounts for land barriers and potential time bias. Temperature and salinity measurements used to create CABOTS were taken from CASTS. Seasonal sea floor temperature and salinity measurements (original and time-adjusted) are included in 3 corresponding NetCDF files. Individual yearly fields are also given in csv files. Finally, NAFO divisional statistics are given in csv files. A complete list of all statistics is included in the README file.
