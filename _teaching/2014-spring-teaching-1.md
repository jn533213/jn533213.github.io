The Canadian Atlantic Shelf Temperature-Salinity (CASTS) data product includes most of the historical temperature and salinity profiles collected in Atlantic Canada and the Eastern Arctic since 1912. CASTS consists of approximately 837,000 individual profiles, bin-averaged to varying resolutions up to a maximum of 5000m (1m resolution up to 1000m depth, 10m resolution up to 2000m depth, and 100m up to 5000m depth). Profile locations were restricted between 35-80 degrees North and 100-42 degrees West. Profiles were gathered from January 1912 to December 2024 and are organized into yearly NetCDF files. Profiles are uniformly formatted and quality controlled allowing users to immediately use the data product. Data fused to make this product were gathered from multiple sources, including regional archives at the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute (DFO-QC), the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (DFO-MAR) and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Centre (DFO-NL). Other sources of data include DFO-NL Aquaculture, the Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland, data from from international ships of opportunity archived by MEDS, the Polar Data Catalogue, etc. A complete list of sources is included in the README file.
